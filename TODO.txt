 You're absolutely right, optimizing for memory usage and model size is critical when deploying real-time transcription. Here are some tips:

- Leverage quantization and pruning techniques to compress the model without losing too much accuracy. Many frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow have tools for this.

- Use a smaller base model like Wav2Vec2 rather than larger models like BERT to start with a smaller footprint.

- Make sure to load the model once at the start and reuse it when processing sequential chunks rather than reloading for every chunk.

- Prefer GPU processing if available since it's more efficient for neural network models than CPU.

- Monitor memory usage as audio is processed and log any spikes.

- Process audio in chunks and flush buffers/caches in between to free up memory.

- For Colab, restart the runtime after long running tasks to free up any leaked memory.

- Consider lower precision numeric formats like 16-bit vs 32-bit floats to reduce model size.

- Compress the audio input samples to mono and lower sample rates to save bandwidth.

- Run profiling tools like Python's memory_profiler to identify any leaks or inefficient allocation.

With some experimentation, you should be able to find a lean model architecture and inference pipeline that can handle real-time transcription without exhausting system memory. Let me know if any other optimization techniques come to mind!
